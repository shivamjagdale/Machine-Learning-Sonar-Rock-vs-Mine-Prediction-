# Machine-Learning-Sonar-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-
We have a submarine and let's say we wanna predict weather we have rock or mine (explosives) on the ocean floor. Here we will use Machine Learning to predict just that. 
Here we are going to us Logistic Regression Model, cause it works really well for Binary Classification Problem. 
Following the standard workflow for ML Model.
